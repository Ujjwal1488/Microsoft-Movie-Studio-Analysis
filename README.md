# Microsoft-Movie-Studio-Analysis
Phase 1 Project
Analysis For Microsoft Movie Studio

Overview

Microsoft is launching a new film studio yet needs information on what kinds of motion pictures to deliver. They need to break down film industry patterns utilizing information from film data sets and ticket deals records. The discoveries can be utilized to direct their choices on film types, financial plan distribution, and promoting systems (conference of a fruitful studio). The proposal is to focus on effective types and consider specialty markets for development.

Business Problem

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. I am charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. I must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.

Since creating a movie studio is already a big movie without knowing what movie to create. Following are the queries: What movies are more popular? What studio does most amount of sales and profit? What studio is the best rated in the market place?
